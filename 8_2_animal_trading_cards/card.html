			<p>Levi is happiest living indoors with the family, but with access to a large, fenced yard, where he can burn off some of his natural energy. He must be kept busy learning, playing, and working. Daily exercise, both physical (such as jogging and Frisbee) and mental (such as training sessions), is a must.</p>
