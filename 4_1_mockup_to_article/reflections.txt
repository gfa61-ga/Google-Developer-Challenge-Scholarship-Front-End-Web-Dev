You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

The new skills I have learned about web development are:
  * the basic structure of an HTML5 page
  * how an html page is organized as an HTML tree of elements and their content
  * how to use "MDN web site" and "W3C Markup Validation Service"
  * the right use of a number of html tags, enough to make me able to translate a designer's mockup to html code
  * the "Markdown" way to format text
  * the basics about using Git locally, pushing my html code to GitHub and accessing the related page through github.io web server
  * how to use codepen.io
  * that it would be useful for me to enroll in Udacity's "Networking for Web Developers" course and so i did.

All the above have been easy for me because I an not a newbie in this field.

It has been difficult for me:
  * to install a Linux Virtual machine with VirtualBox and Vagrant (after a lot of tries I found out that virtualbox 5.1.30 is compatible with Vagrant 1.9.8) and to find the right networks settings for both of them. This environment is required for the exercises of "Networking for Web Developers" course
  * to find more time to read posts and leave feedback in Slack and Udacity Forum and to answer to questions on #livehelp channel.

To overcome challenges so far I have used:
  *  careful studying of the course resources so far
  * "MDN web site" when i needed to find the right tag for a task
  *  "F.A.Q - Google Challenge Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev" to learn the basics about this Scholarschip
  *  other users posts on Slack channels and Forum, to find out a way to post my one work for feedback etc.
